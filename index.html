                <p>Computer Science never fails me to arouse my intellectual curiosity.
                    I would spend hours trying to find the solution to problems such as the <strong>Tower of
                        Hanoi</strong>.
                    Even after I have found a solution, I would look for alternatives to solve the problem more
                    elegantly and efficiently.
                    Computer Science is a <i>never-ending</i> journey of problem-solving and discovery that I would
                    never grow tired of. </p>

                    innovations accessible to everyone – students like me were able to come up with novel solutions to

                    I was <strong>inspired</strong> – as a student I could already do so much with technology.
                    In the future, as a professional, I can expect that the changes that I can make and the lives that I
                    can improve will <i>only</i> be bounded by my imagination.

                    Beyond validating my efforts to improve lives through my various high school tech projects, the
                    “Smart Nation Scholarship” gives me a precious opportunity to work on transforming Singapore into a

                    The opportunity to work on Smart Nation is <strong>especially dear</strong> to me — I have always
                    strived to use technology to help those around me and now I have the chance to directly impact the
                    lives of an entire nation.
                    To make this smart city transformation a success, I am <i>motivated</i> to work even harder and be
                    hungrier for more knowledge.
                    I am <i>motivated</i> to hone not only technical expertise but also my soft skills to understand the
                    subtleties and social implications of technology.
                    I am <i>motivated</i> to bring my city one step closer to utopia.</p>

                        As long as we consistently work towards improving our processes, bit by bit we
                        <strong>will</strong> reach utopia.
